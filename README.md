Preceding Question Prompting

Missing Word Prompting

Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:

Straightforward Prompts:

• "Define photosynthesis in one sentence."

"List three advantages of electric vehicles."

Tabular Format Prompting:

• "Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."

• "Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."

Preceding Question Prompting:

• "Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."

• "How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."

Missing Word Prompting:

• "The capital of France is ____."

• "In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."

 ## OUTPUT:
# 1. Straightforward Prompts:
a.Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, producing oxygen and organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water.

b.Three advantages of electric vehicles are:

Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions: They produce zero tailpipe emissions, significantly lowering air pollution and contributing to climate change mitigation, especially when charged with renewable energy.

Lower Operating and Maintenance Costs: Electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, and EVs have fewer moving parts, reducing expenses for fuel, oil changes, and engine maintenance.

Quieter Operation and Improved Performance: They provide a quieter driving experience and deliver instant torque, resulting in smooth and rapid acceleration.

# 3 Preceding Question Prompting:
a.Climate change is a global concern because its causes, impacts, and solutions transcend national borders. Greenhouse gas emissions anywhere affect the climate everywhere, leading to worldwide consequences like:

Rising sea levels threatening coastal cities and island nations.

Extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods, storms) becoming more frequent and severe.

Disruption of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity.

Risks to food and water security due to shifting agricultural zones and droughts.

b.Vaccines teach your immune system how to recognize and defeat a dangerous germ before it can make you seriously sick. They do this by giving your body a harmless "practice run" of the infection, so it’s prepared for the real thing.

The Process of Immunization in Simple Terms The "Training" Dose: A vaccine is injected (or given orally). It contains either:

A weakened or dead version of the germ.

Just a piece of the germ (like its protein "spike").

Instructions (like mRNA) for your cells to make a harmless piece of the germ.

Key point: This material cannot give you the actual disease. It’s just a recognizable "mugshot" of the enemy.

Immune System "Boot Camp": Your immune system detects this intruder and swings into action:

White blood cells track down and destroy the vaccine material.

More importantly, special cells create antibodies—custom-made "search-and-destroy" weapons designed to latch onto that specific germ.

Creating Memory: After the "practice run" is over, most of the antibodies go away, but your immune system keeps a few special memory cells. These cells "remember" the germ's mugshot for years, sometimes for life.

Future Protection: If the real, live germ ever invades your body in the future, your immune system doesn't start from scratch. The memory cells recognize it immediately, trigger a rapid production of antibodies, and destroy the germ so quickly that you don’t get sick, or you get only a mild illness.

# 4 Missing Word Prompting:
a.The capital of France is Paris.

b.In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen.

# RESULT:
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
